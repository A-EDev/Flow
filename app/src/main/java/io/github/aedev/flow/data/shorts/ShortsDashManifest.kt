/**
 * Wraps a resolved Shorts stream URL in a single-representation DASH manifest.
 *
 * This is what stops YouTube throttling the stream. A plain progressive GET against a googlevideo
 * URL is capped at roughly 50-100 KB/s once the opening burst is spent — enough for VP9 or AV1 at
 * Shorts resolutions, but not for H.264, which needs about twice the bitrate for the same picture.
 * That is why a reel plays for a few seconds and then buffers forever on H.264 while the same reel
 * is fine on AV1 (#917). A manifest carrying the format's init/index byte ranges makes ExoPlayer
 * fetch the stream in ranged chunks instead, which is not throttled.
 *
 * The main player has always done this ([ManifestGenerator], via `VideoPlaybackResolver`); the
 * Shorts pool went straight to `ProgressiveMediaSource` and so never got the benefit.
 *
 * Returns null when a manifest cannot be built — no byte ranges, no duration, an OTF stream. The
 * caller then falls back to a progressive source, which is exactly what Shorts did before.
